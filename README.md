Introduction
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet. Crowdfunding is a form of crowdsourcing and alternative finance. With crowdfunding, it’s much easier for you to get your opportunity in front of more interested parties and give them more ways to help grow your business, from investing thousands in exchange for equity to contributing $20 in exchange for a first-run product or other reward.
This modern crowdfunding model is generally based on three types of actors: the project initiator who proposes the idea or project to be funded, individuals or groups who support the idea, and a moderating organization (the "platform") that brings the parties together to launch the idea.

Problem Statement

• Assume a person or team has started a project and wants some fund for its implementation.

• To fund the project funders can come and fund the project only if funding is in progress. 

• If funding is either stopped or completed no one can fund the project anymore. 

• All the funded money will be transacted to owner (person or team) only when funding is completed (i.e. project meets its funding target) until then all the amount transfers from funders account will be put on hold by contract.
 
• Once funding is completed no other user can further give funds for the project. 

• If owner of campaign stops the funding all the funds given by others will be transacted back to them.
